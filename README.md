# NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is the foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python.

## Features

- **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: NumPy provides powerful data structures for representing arrays of numbers.
- **Efficient Operations**: Supports a wide range of mathematical operations on arrays.
- **Broadcasting**: Efficiently applies operations to arrays of different shapes.
- **Linear Algebra**: NumPy includes a variety of linear algebra routines.
- **Random Number Generation**: Tools for random number generation.
- **Integration with C/C++ and Fortran Code**: NumPy arrays can be passed to and from C/C++ and Fortran code.

## Installation

You can install NumPy using pip:

pip install numpy
